# Note Taker App

## The Project

For this project I've created a note taker application that stores notes within a database to keep local storage clean and healthy. All files are kept on the back end. The app includes the ability to create notes, save notes, and delete as neccessary!

## Usage

Simply fill in a note title, add some text for the notes you're trying to keep, click the save icon at the top right of the screen and- VOILA! You're ready to begin writing another note.
